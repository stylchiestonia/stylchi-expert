We may associate this information with the other personal information we have collected about you. 5. Information About Others Through your use of the Services, we may also collect information from you about someone else. If you provide Stylchi with personal information about someone else, you must ensure that you are authorised to disclose that information to Stylchi and that, without Stylchi taking any further steps required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Stylchi may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Policy.

Disclosing Your Personal Information Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share the personal information that we collect with third parties unless you ask or authorise us to do so. However, there are occasions where we may need to disclose your personal information. Where we do so, any such disclosure will be on the basis that these third parties are required to keep the information we give them confidential and secure, and will not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for us. We may disclose personal information as follows: \\u2022 to affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by Stylchi); \\u2022 to service providers that are hired by us to provide administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as website hosting, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or providing credit card processing services; \\u2022 to Partners where you have purchased services from a Partner through Stylchi, or participated in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or offered through Stylchi on behalf of the Partner. We may also provide Partners with other personal information about you on your Stylchi account to send customised offers, to validate the purchases, to aid and troubleshoot redemption, to combat fraud, as part of legal proceedings affecting Stylchi and the Partner, to facilitate a direct relationship between Partners and customers, and to enable Partners to communicate electronically with customers who make purchases from the Partner; \\u2022 when you rate or review a Service which you have purchased, your rating, review, photo, your first name and last initial will be published on the Stylchi Website and may appear on third party websites. For Partners whose businesses have received reviews on the Stylchi Marketplace, these reviews may be syndicated on third party websites; \\u2022 to business partners and other advertisers as part of an offer, contest, distribution partnership, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Stylchi and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate. For example, if you are referred to Stylchi from a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated by or in conjunction with a Stylchi business partner, Stylchi may provide that business partner with contact information and transactional information; \\u2022 to the public when any user of the Stylchi Website accesses your favourite page. You may, however, hide this information from the public by marking your favourites page as private; \\u2022 to third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this policy; and \\u2022 to our professional advisors. If You Are a Partner We may share some or all of your personal information, including but not limited to booking information, staff member names, Partner offerings, ratings and reviews, prices and discounts, appointment availability, and related data (collectively \\\"Partner Information\\\") with end-users who have signed up or registered for Stylchi and with Stylchi business partners and affiliates with which Stylchi is working: \\u2022 we may feed Partner information to third party websites (excluding customer lists), which may result in Partner information appearing on a third-party website, mobile application or in search engine results; and such results may include a corresponding link to schedule an appointment through Stylchi; \\u2022 Stylchi may contact Partner employees through email to invite them to create a Stylchi account with a restricted login; \\u2022 we may use certain contact information to promote your goods and services through a variety of online and offline advertising and promotional media, including, but not limited to Google, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, Twitter, e-mail distribution lists, and third-party business partners and affiliates; or \\u2022 if you have participated in any joint Partner offerings or promotions with other Partners, Stylchi may disclose your personal information to its Partners and/or advertisers, as part of such offer, contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with Stylchi and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate. Aggregated Data We may use aggregated non-personally identifiable data to: \\u2022 assist us to better understand how our customers are using the Services, \\u2022 provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and benefits of the Services, \\u2022 enhance small business productivity, including by creating useful business insights from that aggregated data and allowing you to benchmark your business\\u2019s performance against that aggregated data, and \\u2022 otherwise to improve the Services. 9. Disclosures Required by Law We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be required to give information to legal and/or regulatory authorities if they so request, or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order. We also may need to retain and disclose certain personal information about you to legal and/or regulatory authorities and to appropriate agencies to conduct anti-money laundering checks and to assist with fraud prevention. We will disclose this information as is required by law. 10. Links to Third Party Websites This Privacy Policy applies solely to the personal information collected by Stylchi and does not apply to third party websites. Stylchi is not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites. You should read the privacy policies of other websites before providing them with any personal information about you. 11. Your Rights In relation to the personal information we hold about you, you may be entitled to ask us: \\u25CF For a copy of your personal information \\u25CF To correct, erase or restrict the processing of your personal information \\u25CF To obtain personal data which you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine-readable format and to ask us to transfer this information to another organisation \\u25CF To object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don\\u2019t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirements, or where we are using the data for direct marketing). In the first instance, you may be able to view or change the information you have provided us with by logging in to your online account. Your rights in relation to your personal information are limited in some situations. For example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or if we have a legal requirement or a compelling legitimate ground we may continue to process Personal Information which you have asked us to delete. You also may have the right to make a complaint if you feel your personal information has been mishandled. We encourage you to come to us in the first instance but, to the extent that this right applies to you, you are entitled to complain directly to the relevant supervisory authority. If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at hello@Stylchi.com. Please note, however, that no financial information will be provided without verification. If you are not happy with our response, or you believe that your information protection or privacy rights have been infringed, you should contact the EU Information Commissioner's Office, which oversees information protection compliance in the European Union. Details of how to do this can be found at https://edps.europa.eu/. 12. Updating this Privacy Policy We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Website and we will also revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we hold. 13.
